# Data Analysis Portfolio  

## About Me  
Hi, Iâ€™m Mary, a passionate data analyst with a strong foundation in data analysis, having studied online with Cisco Networking Academy. I have honed my skills using **SQL, Excel, Google Sheets, and Tableau** to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets.  

As a lifelong learner, I am always in pursuit of new knowledge and skills. Currently, I am exploring Streamlit and Python to expand my analytical capabilities. Whether working independently or in a team, I focus on attention to detail and delivering valuable insights to help clients make data-driven decisions.  

This portfolio showcases my recent projects, where I have worked with large datasets to uncover trends and drive strategic decisions.
